# Mapping — Sitemap ↔ Code ↔ Figma

The single pointer file. Each sitemap page ties to its code and (later) its Figma frame.
Process is in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md): **add page to FigJam → write code → capture into Figma.**

## Sources

- 📋 **Todo App — Project board** (FigJam, source of truth for docs & specs): https://www.figma.com/board/Qyo8JqnW7hQ4neaBAzG9K9 — zones: Project · Sitemap (flow) · Page specs
- 🗂️ **Backlog**: GitHub Project "Agentic workflow" (Issues) — https://github.com/users/marthings/projects/1
- 💻 **Code**: this repo — `src/App.tsx`
- 🎨 **Figma design file** (captured screens): https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF
- 🎟️ **Design tokens ↔ Figma**: collections **Color** (Light/Dark), **Spacing**, **Radius**, **Font Size**, **Line Height** + six **text styles** (Display/Title/Heading/Body/Label/Caption) in the design file (canonical for tokens). Captured screens are **bound** to them — fills/strokes/radii reference the variables; text nodes use the styles. Code mirror in `src/index.css`. See [`design-tokens.md`](./design-tokens.md).

## Pages

| Page | Dev URL | Code | Figma frame |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
| Home / Task List | `/` | `src/App.tsx` — `currentView === 'list'` (incl. multi-select bulk delete) | [node 49:2](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=49-2) |
| New Task | `/?view=create` | `src/App.tsx` — `currentView === 'create'` | [node 63:3](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=63-3) |
| Task Detail | `/?view=detail` · `/?share=…` | `src/App.tsx` — `currentView === 'detail'` (incl. Share link) | [node 64:3](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=64-3) |
| Settings | `/?view=settings` | `src/App.tsx` — `currentView === 'settings'` (incl. dark mode toggle) | [node 62:3](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=62-3) |
| History & Stats | `/?view=history` | `src/App.tsx` — `currentView === 'history'` (status breakdown #30 + due-date insights #31) | _pending capture (#32)_ |

When a new page is added to the sitemap, add a row here. After re-capturing, the frame node id may change — update the link.

## Components (code ↔ Figma ↔ Code Connect)

Reusable components live in `src/components/`, are built as real Figma components (variant sets bound to our variables/text styles), and are linked with Code Connect files.

| Component | Code | Figma node | Code Connect |
|-----------|------|------------|--------------|
| Button | `src/components/Button.tsx` | [20:7](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=20-7) (Primary/Secondary) | `Button.figma.tsx` |
| Card | `src/components/Card.tsx` | [23:2](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=23-2) | `Card.figma.tsx` |
| StatusBadge | `src/components/StatusBadge.tsx` | [23:10](https://www.figma.com/design/HM0wHv6sz11nOjnifpBXjF?node-id=23-10) (Todo/In Progress/Done) | `StatusBadge.figma.tsx` |

**This table + the `.figma.tsx` files are our canonical mapping** — they don't depend on Code Connect
being enabled. The `.figma.tsx` files are precise and machine-readable even unpublished (component →
node URL + variant/prop mapping). Keep them honest with a **verify pass**: read the Figma component's
property definitions via the MCP and diff against the code prop unions + the `.figma.tsx` enum maps.
Last verified consistent (Button `Variant`=Primary/Secondary, StatusBadge `Status`=Todo/In Progress/Done).

**Code Connect (optional upgrade):** the in-Figma Dev-Mode display is **gated** — it requires an
Organization/Enterprise plan with a Dev or Full seat (this file is on a Pro team). When available:
`npx figma connect publish` (needs `@figma/code-connect` + a `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`). The `.figma.tsx`
files are already in the right format; nothing to rewrite. They're excluded from the app build via
`tsconfig.app.json`.
